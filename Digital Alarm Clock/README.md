# Digital Alarm Clock
The project contains a Digital Alarm Clock. Users can set many alarms. 
The first part of the project contains a digital clock that keeps on getting updated every second. In the second part, we can set the alarm, and all the new alarms will be added to a list below and played at the right time. With every new alarm set, a delete button will appear. On clicking the Delete button, the alarm can be disabled and removed from the webpage.

# TechStack: 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

# Approach:
All the alarms set will be added to an array. The array will be checked continuously to see if it contains the current time. If it does, then the alarm sound will be played. 
On clicking on "Stop alarm," the audio will be paused, and on clicking on "Delete Alarm," the said alarm will be removed from the array and the list.
